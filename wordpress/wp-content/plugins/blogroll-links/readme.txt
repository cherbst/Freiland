Blogroll Links displays a list of URL links and related info in a Post or Page on your Wordpress Blog. It is often used for tagged, social links.

== Description ==

For people who maintain their Web site or blog using the WordPress blog content management system,
blogroll-links is an open source WordPress plugin that uses WordPress’ built-in Blogroll feature and presents links to friends’ home pages and own pages on social networking sites using XFN in the links.

Features of this plugin

* It can show the links by category in blog posts and WordPress Pages.
* It uses WordPress’ standard built-in Blogroll links database. There is no hassle of another list of links to maintain.
* It can be used to show only the links assigned to a particular category, by stating the category slug as defined in that category’s setting in Wordpress.
* It honors the Show/Hidden setting as defined for each link in WordPress.
* It displays the link in the same window or new window, as specified for each link in WordPress.
