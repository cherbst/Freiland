Blogroll Links displays a list of URL links and related info in a Post or Page on your Wordpress Blog. It is often used for tagged, social links.

== Description ==

For people who maintain their Web site or blog using the WordPress blog content management system,
blogroll-links is an open source WordPress plugin that uses WordPress’ built-in Blogroll feature and presents links to friends’ home pages and own pages on social networking sites using XFN in the links.

Features of this plugin

* It can show the links by category in blog posts and WordPress Pages.
* It uses WordPress’ standard built-in Blogroll links database. There is no hassle of another list of links to maintain.
* It can be used to show only the links assigned to a particular category, by stating the category slug as defined in that category’s setting in Wordpress.
* It honors the Show/Hidden setting as defined for each link in WordPress.
* It displays the link in the same window or new window, as specified for each link in WordPress.

**Examples**

See this plugin in action at the following Posts and Pages powered by WordPress:


[www.rajiv.com/friends/](http://www.rajiv.com/friends/)

The two lists, first one of links to my own pages on various social networking sites and the second one of links to some of my friends’ pages are generated by this plugin. Yes, those social networks’ logo pictures are also taken by the plugin from the WordPress standard Blogroll links. Code:

`<h3>My Pages on Social Networking Sites</h3>`

Syntax:

`[blogroll-links categoryslug="rajiv-web" sortby="link_name" sortorder="desc"]`

Old syntax for legacy support:
`<!--blogroll-links category-slug="rajiv-web" sort-by="link_name" sort-order="desc"--><!--/blogroll-links-->`



`<h3>Web Sites of Some People I Know</h3>`

Syntax:

`[blogroll-links categoryslug="people" sortby="link_name" sortorder="desc"]`


[www.rajiv.com/charity/](http://www.rajiv.com/charity/)

This list of charitable organizations with brief descriptions is generated by the plugin. Code:

Syntax:

`[blogroll-links categoryslug="charity"]`



[www.rajiv.com/blog/2004/08/02/search-engines/](http://www.rajiv.com/blog/2004/08/02/search-engines/)

This list of search engines is maintained as Blogroll links in WordPress. Code:

Syntax:

`[blogroll-links categoryslug="search-engines"]`



[www.rajiv.com/](http://www.rajiv.com/)

The featured links shown under the “What’s featured here?” section shows the links I’ve categorized as featured in WordPress’ Blogroll links. Code:

`<a title="featured" name="featured"></a>`

`<h2>What's featured here?</h2>`

Syntax:

`[blogroll-links categoryslug="featured" sortby="link_name" sortorder="desc"]`
